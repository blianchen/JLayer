03/04/2002: JavaLayer 0.1.2
---------------------------

 - API improved to let developers get MP3 bitrate, framelength and total time features.
 - Additionnal files added (CHANGES.txt and LICENSE.txt).


10/01/2001: JavaLayer 0.1.1
---------------------------

 - Bugs fixes in the decoder (Layer III).


07/02/2001: JavaLayer 0.1.0
---------------------------

 - Streaming support added to the simple player (jlp). 
 - Bugs fixes in the simple player (too fast playback for low rate files).


06/04/2001: JavaLayer 0.0.9
---------------------------

 - Bugs fixes in Layer I and Layer II decoder. 
 - ANT build script added.
 - HTML page added to play MP3 through PlayerApplet in a JavaSound 1.0 (JDK 1.3) 
   compliant browser.


04/16/2000: JavaLayer 0.0.8 
---------------------------
A simple player have been added and you can now play MP3 in real time with JVM 
that supports JavaSound 1.0 (i.e JDK 1.3). 

 - Bug fixes. 
 - Decoder improvements. 
 - Build Scripts have been added for Win32 and Unix platforms. 


12/16/1999: JavaLayer 0.0.7 
---------------------------
JavaLayer 0.0.7 contains significant improvements over version 0.0 :

 - API and documentation added.
 - The decoder is much more faster. Fast enough for real-time decoding.
 - Huffman/Layer3 tables serialization added. 
 - New buffers management. 
 - Exceptions + Utils added. 
 - Bugs fixes.


02/28/1999: JavaLayer 0.0
-------------------------
JavaLayer V0.0 does not play any MP3 but it allows the MP3toWAV conversion.
This is the first step in this project. We do it thanks to free mp3 ressources 
available on the net:

 - MAPlay for the OO MP3 decoder (C++).
 - WAV format description from Microsoft. 

The MP3 decoder works now but it is too slow to allow real time implementation.
